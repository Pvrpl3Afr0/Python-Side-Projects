Some programs I've written on my own for practice

Test Password Gen.py: I looked up how the .join func works and how I can use the random library to call upon random characters and make a password generator. I can add much more to this in terms of security but this is a great way for simple character strings. 

Keylogger from Tinkernut.pyw: I saw a tutorial on youtube for a simple keylogger using imported windows functions and logging funcs. The code itself seems pretty easy but implementing is hard because I'm having import errors and have nowhere to test this besides my own system.

Working RNG for Hypothesis Testing.py: I wrote this program for my Stats class. I wanted to see if it were more or less likely to get an even number than an odd number using Pseudo Random numbers. This is a simple script using the random library.
